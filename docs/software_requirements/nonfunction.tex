\section{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}
% Nonfunctional requirements are shall-statements about how the software
% performs or is written.  It is not a statement about what the software does.
% For example, the function requirements for a Fibonacci function is this: the
% function shall return the nth Fibonacci number when provided n as input.  A
% nonfunctional requirement would be these: the function shall take time O(n)
% and all lines of the software shall be reachable by some test-case.
%

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
% Your project will have performance requirements.  How long is the user willing
% to wait for the different features to execute?   For example, the software
% shall authenticate authorized users withing 250ms.   

\subsection{Safety Requirements}
% It is unlikely that your project will have any safety requirements.  This
% section would be used for software that controls a physical device that could
% potentially cause harm.  

\subsection{Security Requirements}
% Do not overlook this section.  Consider the three primary topics of computer
% security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.   Your project will
% have security requirements. 
%

\subsection{Software Quality Attributes}
% Quality requirements can be the most difficult to write.  The desired quality
% must be written in a meaningful and testable way.  For example, All functions
% within the software shall have a cyclomatic number less than 10.
